# Horse derby school work

## about
### A simple code project for the js module, were I had to make a horse race and watch them compete for first place.
### The values are pre set but the calculations include randomness, to make it better for gambling.
### The html and css is made with ai, I do apologize in advance for that, a few attempts of animations with ai were made but I gave up
